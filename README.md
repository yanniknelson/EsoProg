# How To Build
Ensure you get this repository recursively as the vendors have been added as sub modules.
Once you have the source, go into the Scripts folder and run the setup script for your OS.<br><br>
Now you have your solution, there should be a Premake Project inside it, to update your solution, you can rebuild that project.
From here you should be able to build using visual studio.

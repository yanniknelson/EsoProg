EsoProg is intended to be a programming playground for esoteoric languages such as:

	1. Piet [x]
	2. BrainF*ck []
	3. COW []
	4. Auld []

# How To Build
To build this program you must have vcpkg and cmake installed.
I then recommend you use visual studio to open the repro director and build from there.
